# WITTY CALENDAR


## INTRODUCTION
The Witty Calendar is a fun, snarky way to track tasks and important dates, that a regular calendar can't provide.
Most calendars only provide the ability to jot a date, time, and the task to remember.
The Witty Calendar provides users with the motivation to complete their tasks on time.
Because if they miss their due date, they'll be insulted.
Not only does the calendar keep users motivated, but it's also entertaining.
